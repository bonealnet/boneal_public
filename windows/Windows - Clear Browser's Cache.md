### Windows - Clear Browser's Cache
***
###### Clear the entire contents of the browser's cache by performing the following steps:
* Close your browser (if-open)
* Open your browser to a blank page (using google.com works fine, too)
* Press (combo-keypress)    SHIFT + CTRL + DELETE    to open a popup window containing the browser's cache-clearing tool
* If using Chrome to browse, at the top of the popup window, select "Advanced" (instead of "Basic")
* At the top of the popup, in the 'Time Range' dropdown (if available) select the max time-range (e.g. "All Time", or "Everything")
* In the popup window, check/select ALL options shown
* At the bottom of the popup window, press "Clear" (may show as "Clear Now", "Clear Data", etc.) to confirm & clear the browser's cache
