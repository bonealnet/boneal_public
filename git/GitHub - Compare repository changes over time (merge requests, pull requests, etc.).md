###### On GitHub, create a new pull request for the repo in-question (which you wish to compare over a given time period)

###### For the FROM branch (right branch-dropdown within the pull-request), type the name of the branch in-question (or type 'master' for the trunk), and append your time-period's END date, wrapped in curly braces and matching format MM-DD-YY, onto the right-side of the branch-name (example: master{MM-DD-YY})
###### For the TO branch (left branch-dropdown within the pull-request), type the same branch as the previous step, and append your time-period's START date, wrapped in curly braces and matching format MM-DD-YY, onto the right-side of the branch-name (example: master{MM-DD-YY})

###### Example:
<pre><code>
TO:    master{08-01-19}
FROM:  master
</code></pre>
